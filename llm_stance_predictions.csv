6,"people who profit from sickness or the operation of medical services for profit

people who profit from convincing a group of fervent people into giving up their money directly  see the grifteconomy around this whole issue and how it pivots into a brand lifestyle these people attach to multiple different ideas and frequently shift if one proves unprofitable

you pointed out the possibility of state sponsored misinformation in order to reduce stability which could credibly apply to a number of different topics but i will suggest such a policy would be short sighted on this particular topic for the simple reason that we all live in the same petri dish stupid but far from impossible i think if too many actors started to use this strategy it would break down in effectiveness and turn into a ratrace

this is more my personal take but people who want the respect a medical professional receives who by necessity must degrade all other medical creeds in order to sell you on their own brand of medicine some people just really want you to see them as the font of truth especially on a matter so critical as medicine and i have personally encountered a number of people in whom i can only describe this as being a pathological need though i think some of those people inclined this way actually become doctors and theyre usually assholes about it doctors are known for their egos for a reason as my job brings me into regular contact with them these people often commit to this even when its deleterious to their own life through direct health effects or prosecution or actively kills those around them for an extreme example the people who give babies bleach enemas supposedly to cure their autism for a less extreme example your woowoo aunt who tries to make you snort powdered dreamroot to cure your asthma compared to the grifters these people are either true believers or unconcerned with the concept of truth as long as youre listening to them they benefit in a personal sense primarily and sometimes a money sense secondarily 

you should also consider the role of general antiintellectualism and that vaccines are very easy to make sound scary and that people are fully capable of ginning up random panics around anything they dont understand for no benefit at all except their own effacement i have to routinely tell people that potassium ferrocyanide wont kill them or their pets but they only believe me about a third of the time because its a scawy chemical name this group is the signal booster the others rely on but if someone doesnt make something up for them theyll just find something else to panic about if it wasnt vaccines itd be food dyes or whatever

 everyone got covid factually incorrect there are all manner of people who did not get covid so starting off with this as a major premise is unsound
 this leads into a form of fallacious reasoning known as hasty generalization where you have drawn a conclusion about the effectiveness of restrictions from incomplete sets on only one particular outcome people getting covid which then leads into
 another logical fallacy that the only two outcomes to restrictions are possible we know this isnt the case and this isnt even the intention of pandemic restrictions so potentially another strawman the existence of infections does not mean public health measures have failed in fact we see the opposite in infection rates and mortality rates between populations that largely do respect pandemic measures and those that dont
 those three points are all interchangeably forms of false cause cherrypicking and argument from anecdote fallacies on top of the ones i listed
 youve also demonstrated a categorical misunderstanding of how public health measures are implemented and what they are used for on top of glossing over the complexity of disease spread

2_1,"overall it seems to have caused a death rate of between  based on statistical analysis from steve kirsch edward dowd and others my rough estimate after reading their research and there has been an all cause mortality rise in the countries using covid vaccines so yes it probably adds up to hundreds of millions worldwide it mostly gets counted as other causes of death though such as heart failure immune system failure and cancer in the us its probably somewhere around k   million dead and many more disabled

i think this is the reason they pushed for legal and illegal immigration so hard in recent years with so many dead and disabled if there hadnt been immigration the companies wouldve had to start paying workers more due to the low supply of good workers they needed replacements for all the dead and disabled americans the huge layoffs from big companies may have also been a cover story for workers actually dying or getting disabled",Neutral,Oppose,Oppose
